For this project we were tasked to make an interactive spatial drone involving quadrophonic sound, sampling, engineering, and composition writing. My role in this project was to write the composition.

My classmate Mayla, sampled a Nyckelharpa, which is a Swedish instrument similar in sound to a violin. Because the Nyckelharpa is a drone instrument, it makes for a cool sound to experiment with on a quad sound system. Mayla turned the samples into a .vst file through decent sampler which allows the Nyckelharpa to be distributed. 

Using a DAW, in my case, Ableton, I could access the sampled instrument using plug-ings. I had a difficult time coming up with finding the direction that I wanted to take the composition. The Nyckelharpa is often used in folk genre music, utilizing a combination of sharp and and drawn notes to make patterns. As this is not ideal to recreate on a DAW, I decided to layer notes, making chords. I wanted to also play around with this because it's difficult to do this in real life unless multiple musicians are involved. 

Using this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UShjYsGgWcM , I was able to learn more about how drone instruments can be maximized for an audience's experience. I tried my best to have three layers of the drone playing different things, a bass part, alto, and soprano. I also used some reverb and saturation effects to bring out the Nyckelharpa sound. I also decided to play more heavily with the dynamics of the stems rather than panning because it each stem would be transferred over four speakers instead of just two.

In the end, I had 6 total stems:
  -3 Nyckelharpa parts
  -bass
  -washy sounding drums
  -bells

The end-result turned into a piece that sounded similar to a fantasy entertainment sound track.
