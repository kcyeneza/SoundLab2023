# Decent Sampler, sampled instrument

For this assignment we were tasked to sample an instrument of our choosing and map it to midi using decent sampler.
I used my samples from the Korg M1 assignemnt, using two different velocities, soft and loud to get more accurate results.

## Mapping to midi

Using decent sampler, coded in xml, I was able to sample the circle of fifths in two different velocities, group them accordingly and then map then using the midi chart. 

## UI

For this assignment, I just changed the background image to a blue picture with texture and then changed the font color to white so it matches. 


## Convolution Reverb 

I added convolution reverb from 5 different rooms including: the stairwell, Norlin Hallway, the elevator in Norlin, my living room, and bathroom.
