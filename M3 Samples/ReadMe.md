# Hammond M3 Organ Sampling

For this project we were asked to sample the Hammond Organ.
Mayla and I worked on this project together, using the same samples on the organ while utilizing the samples in different ways.
For the sampling portion, we didn't change any of the drawbar settings on the Hammond organ and we sampled the organ with it's original sound (played around with effects in Ableton). With this project we decided to do a direct line in, as to not catch any of the clicking parts of playing the keys. This also allowed sus to cut out any other sounds when recording. We didn't use any round robins with our sampling because we also thought that the direct line in gave us very clear sounds for our samples.

## Making the sound sample

With the sound sample, I decided to add some distortion to the organ. I put all the samples in the drum rack and then using the E flat as a holding note for most of the sample.
I then layered it with some oscillating notes, and added some bass.
